### Key Observations:
- **February** marked the lowest performance across both metrics: orders dropped **31.5%** and AOV fell to **$116.93 (-12.3%)**, resulting in the sharpest monthly revenue decline.
- **March to July** showed steady recovery. **July** was particularly strong â€” it had one of the **highest order counts (140)** and also the **highest AOV ($145.60)**, contributing to a secondary revenue peak.
- **November** had the **second-lowest order volume**, but revenue stayed relatively stable thanks to a **significant increase in AOV ($143.78, +30.9%)** â€” indicating customers placed fewer but higher-value orders.

### Recommendations:
- **Stabilize February** with early Q1 promotions or loyalty pushes to avoid simultaneous drops in both volume and value.
- **Leverage high-AOV months** (like **July and November**) to introduce premium product bundles or upsell offers.
- Use insights from **Novemberâ€™s high-AOV behavior** to build **holiday season strategies** that focus on value per customer, even if volume is lower.
- Tailor marketing to monthly AOV patterns â€” deploy **basket-size incentives** during low-AOV periods and focus on **premium promotions** during high-AOV months.

## Part 7: Deep Dive â€“ Product Category Breakdown

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7b406f3-a4c0-42ae-893d-cc3d62586bba)

### Key Observations:
In 2023, January recorded the highest monthly revenue, driven by increases across nearly all product categories â€” particularly Personal Care. The only exception was Household, which declined slightly.

In contrast, February experienced the lowest revenue of the year, showing a steep 39.9% drop from January. This was primarily due to sharp declines across all major categories, especially:

- Beverages: â†“ 63.9%  
- Dairy: â†“ 42.4%  
- Snacks: â†“ 47.0%

Revenue recovered strongly in March, increasing by 42% compared to February, mainly due to:

- Beverages: â†‘ 102%  
- Household: â†‘ 81.6%

From March through July, revenue showed a general upward trend, peaking with a spike in May, despite Snacks contributing only 6% of total revenue that month â€” indicating other categories (especially Beverages and Personal Care) drove the growth.

After July, revenue dipped slightly in August, then remained relatively stable through November, before picking up again in December â€” likely reflecting end-of-year consumer activity and holiday demand.

### Recommendations:

- **Reinforce Inventory and Promotions Before February:**  
  The steep February drop across all categories suggests systemic weaknesses in campaign timing or stock availability. Launch **bridge promotions or loyalty offers in late January** to extend demand and reduce early Q1 drop-offs.

- **Optimize Beverages Promotion Strategy:**  
  Beverages showed both extreme drops and major spikes, indicating sensitivity to promotion timing. Distribute campaigns more evenly across the year to **smooth volatility** and maintain customer interest consistently.

- **Prioritize Personal Care and Household During Key Quarters:**  
  These two categories showed dependable contributions and seasonal peaks. Allocate **more promotional budget and shelf space** in Q2 and Q4 when performance tends to climb.

- **Re-evaluate Snack Product Strategy:**  
  With Snacks contributing only 6% of revenue in May and showing weak performance throughout, conduct a **SKU-level review**. Consider bundling, price repositioning, or even discontinuing underperforming lines.

- **Plan for Year-End Demand Early:**  
  Revenue rebound in December was likely driven by seasonal purchases. Begin **holiday planning by October**, focusing on categories like Personal Care and Household that align with gifting and seasonal household needs.
