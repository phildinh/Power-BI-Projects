# HR Dashboard Visualization with Power BI

## Project Overview

This HR Dashboard project is designed to provide key insights into the workforce dynamics of an organization using Power BI. It visualizes various HR metrics such as staff distribution by role, gender and age diversity, salary distributions by qualification, and staffing trends over time. This dashboard serves as a crucial tool for HR managers to make informed decisions regarding recruitment, diversity initiatives, and compensation policies.

## Features

- **Staff Distribution**: View the number of staff categorized by different roles within the company to understand resource allocation.
- **Gender and Age Distribution**: Analyze the diversity of the workforce in terms of gender and age.
- **Salary and Qualifications Analysis**: Explore how different qualifications correlate with salary ranges across the organization.
- **Growth Trends**: Monitor the growth of staff numbers over the years to measure how the company's workforce is expanding.

## Questions from Stakeholder (HR Department)

1. **How many employees are currently working in each role, and are there any roles that might be under-resourced?**
2. **Can you provide a breakdown of qualifications and salary ranges across different roles to help us identify areas where additional training might be necessary?**
3. **What is the current gender ratio within our company, and how can we improve gender balance to meet our diversity goals?**
4. **Could you analyze the age distribution of our workforce to assist with our planning for retirement, succession, and to tailor our benefits and training programs?**
5. **Considering our recent growth, how has the number of employees changed over the past years, and is this growth aligned with our long-term strategic objectives?**

## Answers and Recommendations

1. **Currently, the number of employees in each role varies, with certain departments showing potential signs of being under-resourced.** A detailed analysis reveals specific roles that may require additional staffing to meet operational demands effectively.

2. **A detailed breakdown of qualifications and corresponding salary ranges across different roles has been compiled.** This data highlights discrepancies and identifies potential areas where upskilling or training is advisable, ensuring that all employees are equipped to meet their role requirements competently.

3. **The current gender distribution shows a slight imbalance favoring one gender.** To address this and improve our diversity goals, strategic hiring practices and internal promotions that focus on achieving a more balanced gender ratio are recommended.

4. **Analysis of the age distribution within our company indicates a diverse range of age groups.** This diversity necessitates tailored benefits and specific training programs designed to cater to the varied needs of different age groups, as well as proactive planning for upcoming retirements and succession.

5. **Our analysis of employee growth over recent years shows a steady increase in staff numbers, aligning with the companyâ€™s expansion goals.** However, to ensure sustainability, it is crucial to continue monitoring this trend closely and adjust hiring strategies as needed to support long-term objectives.
