# 📊 HR Analytics Dashboard – Power BI Project

A comprehensive HR Analytics solution focusing on **Headcount**, **Retention**, and **Turnover** — three key metrics every HR department needs to manage workforce effectively.

Without clear visibility into these areas, businesses risk high recruitment costs, low employee morale, and talent gaps.

Build an intuitive Power BI dashboard that gives HR professionals instant insights into workforce dynamics, helping them make better decisions around staffing, engagement, and retention strategies.

- See year-over-year retention improvements.
- Spot trends by **Job Level**, **Department**, and **Education**.
- Quickly identify areas with strong retention and those needing attention.

📈 *Key Insight:*

### 4️⃣ **Turnover Analysis**

Turnover can be costly. This dashboard answers:
- What’s our annual turnover rate?
- Which departments and job levels experience the most exits?
- Are employees leaving voluntarily or involuntarily?
- What are the common reasons for leaving? (e.g., better benefits, salary, opportunities)

📉 *Key Insight:*  
- Majority (81%) of exits are **voluntary**, highlighting competition in the job market.
- **Customer Service** and **Procurement** departments face the highest turnover rates.
