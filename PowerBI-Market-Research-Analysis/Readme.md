# Market Research Analytics Dashboard

## Overview  
The Market Research Analytics Dashboard is designed to provide in-depth insights into the performance of 6 campaigns, products, customer demographics, and key influencers for our campaigns. It serves as a decision-making tool for the marketing team, business leaders, and end-users, enabling them to understand campaign performance, revenue generation by products, customer preferences, and key factors influencing each campaign.

## Features  
- **Data Model**: The dashboard utilizes a star schema with one-to-many relationships and supports both cross-filter directions. This setup allows for efficient dashboard building and feature manipulation within the dataset.
- **Campaign Performance**: This section highlights the performance of various campaigns, including the number of purchases, generated sales, and the effectiveness of different platforms used across campaigns.
- **Buyer Composition**: The Buyer Composition section breaks down customer demographics such as education level, marital status, income, age, and preferences. It helps in understanding the customer profile and how different groups respond to campaigns.

## Tools Used  
- **Power BI**: For creating interactive and dynamic visualizations.
- **Power Query**: Used for data preparation and transformation.
- **PowerPoint**: Used for creating templates and preparing color schemes for the dashboard.

## Purpose  
The dashboard was developed at the request of business leaders to answer the following questions:
- How are 6 recent marketing campaigns performing?
- How are our products performing?
- Who are our customers?
- What is driving campaign performance and buyer decision-making?

### 1. Campaign Performance
- **Observation**: Campaign 6 performed the best in terms of purchases, significantly outperforming other campaigns with a total of 334 attributed purchases. Wine was the top-selling product across all campaigns, with a major portion of the sales attributed to in-store purchases.
- **Analysis**: Campaign 6's success could be attributed to a well-executed marketing strategy, focusing on wine as the main product and leveraging multiple sales channels, particularly in-store. The data suggests that physical store purchases dominate, suggesting that customers prefer purchasing products in person rather than online or through catalogs.

### 2. Buyer Composition
- **Observation**: The majority of customers are married (864), and most have attained a college/university degree (1127). The average income of customers opting into campaigns is approximately $52,247, with a significant percentage of them falling into the age range of 50 to 80.
- **Analysis**: The customer base for these campaigns is predominantly married individuals with higher education levels, which aligns with the types of products being marketed. The average income indicates a middle to upper-middle-class target demographic. As customers age, their preferences shift, with wine sales increasing and meat sales decreasing, which suggests the need for tailored marketing strategies for older consumers.

## Overall Recommendations  
- Target campaigns based on demographic insights, focusing more on the 50-80 age group, especially for wine and baked goods, as these products align well with their preferences.
- Expand in-store promotions, given that physical store purchases dominate across most campaigns.  
- Leverage data from successful campaigns (like Campaign 6) to refine future strategies, ensuring product and platform choices align with customer expectations.
- Continuously track customer preferences based on age, marital status, and income to further personalize marketing efforts and increase engagement.
